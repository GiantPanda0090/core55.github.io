				<h2>Sprint 1: "To create the MVP web application"</h2>
				<!-- <span class="image left">
				<img src="" alt>
				</span> -->
				<p>Considering our limited prior knowledge of Scrum and agile methodologies the project got underway to an excellent start!<br>The back-end team were able to set up a RESTful web-server and implement the Java Persistence API to access a relational database in an object oriented fashion. 
				The front-end team designed and built a share-button as well as icons for the map to facilitate our initial user interface. They also manged to integrate the Google Maps API into the UI.
				The team succeeded in building up a connection between front- and back-end to create a fully functional MVP:<br>A 'meetup' can be created, to which new users can be added with the use of the share button. Users are able to see the location of other users on the same map.
				<!-- build a fully functional api
				communicate with backend for exchange data
				update user location 
				retrieve locations from other user on map
				display markers on map
				design: create map, icons, markers, sharing link, and copying  -->
