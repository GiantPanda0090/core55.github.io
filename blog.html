					We are setting out to create a service that enables people to spontaneously meet up anywhere. Users will be able to join a <i>meetup</i> and see the location of their friends on a map. Our service will be available as both a web- and an android-application.<br><br><i>Tuesday - April 18<sup>th</sup></i><p>

					<h2>Sprint 1: "To create the MVP web application"</h2>
					<p>
					<!-- <span class="image.left"><img src="./images/app-screen1a.png"></span> -->
					Considering our limited prior knowledge of Scrum and agile methodologies the project got underway to an excellent start!<br>The back-end team were able to set up a RESTful web-server and implement the Java Persistence API to access a relational database in an object oriented fashion. 
					The front-end team designed and built a share-button as well as icons for the map to facilitate our initial user interface. They also manged to integrate the Google Maps API into the UI.
					The team succeeded in building up a connection between front- and back-end to create a fully functional MVP:<br>A <i>meetup</i> can be created, to which new users can be added with the use of the share button. Users are able to see the location of other users on the same map.

					<h2>Sprint 2: â€œIntroduce authentication, improve user experience and build android app"</h2>
					<p>
					<!-- <span class="image.left"><img src="./images/app-screen1a.png"></span> -->
					After having completed the second sprint the team has now built a fully functional android app. 
					<br>The back-end team have implemented authentication using JSON Web Tokens as well as job scheduling to expire tokens. An email infrastructure has been set up to enable login via a magic link. Furthermore the user functionality has been improved to enable custom user names, statuses and ten most recent locations.
					<br>
					The front-end team worked on improving the UI by designing and enabling smooth updating of pins. Users can personalise their experience with the use of a nickname prompt. An out of bounds pointer has been added to show the rough location of users that are not visible on the map.  The front-end has also been deployed on heroku.
					<br>
					For this sprint we launched an android team. The team built an app that resembles the web app. It uses the location services of a device to position the user on the map. The app offers authentication with Google sign in and the use of an App Link.

					<h2>More features!!!</h2>

					<!-- <span class="image.left"><img src="./images/app-screen1a.png"></span> -->
					The third sprint is well under way and the team is working on some awesome features such as navigation, status updates, drop down lists and user activity. Both the design and UI are constantly improving. Authentication and authorization are also being tackled at the moment. Stay tuned for the upcoming demo on Wednesday.
