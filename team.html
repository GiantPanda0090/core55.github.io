				<h2>Marcel</h2>
				<p>Coming soon...</p>
			
				<h2>Phillip</h2>
				<p>During the first sprint Phillip has mainly been working on the back-end team; implementing CRUD operations and generating unique hash values for our users and 'meetups'. He enjoyed exploring the Spring framework and furthering his knowledge of git. He also spent some time working on documentation and the website.<p>
			
				<h2>Hussam</h2>
				<p>Coming soon...</p>
			
				<h2>Qi</h2>
				<p>Coming soon</p>
			
				<h2>Jiho</h2>
				<p>Jiho has been working on the front-end team and worked on getting the geolocation of a user when the map is opened. The users' geolocation is directed onto the center of the map and updated every two minutes. She worked with Juan Luis to interact with the back-end database.</p>
			
				<h2>Dean</h2>
				<p>Coming soon...</p>

				<h2>Patrick</h2>
				<p>Being part of the back-end team, Patrick took part in the setup of the server and API for the application. He started implementing custom status code responses and API authentication through tokens. He has also been working on the database for storing 'meetups' and users.</p>
			
				<h2>Juan Luis</h2>
				<p>In the first sprint Juan Luis started familiarizing himself with the WebStorm environment as well as the Vue.js framework. After mastering this tool he collaborated with other members of the front-end team in the development of the web view. This included utilizing the Google Maps API to display a map within the user's current position and with markers of the location from other users registered in it. He cooperated actively as well in the sending and retrieving the information to and from the back-end API. He think he did a wonderful job, in fact, his mum would be really proud.</p>
			
				<h2>Cedric</h2>
				<p>Coming soon...</p>
			
				<h2>Simone</h2>
				<p>During the sprint 1 Simone has been mostly working on creating a back-end API in order to support the web app (and the Android app in the future). A lot of time was spent learning the Spring framework and proper design and structure of RESTful API that is HATEOAS compliant.</p>
